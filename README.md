# Magic-Base
A system for ranking and sorting M:tG cards in order of value rather than popularity.

The purpose of magic base is to establish, for each magic card, a value relative to its efficiency at producing a given
mechanical effect. The final product requires 2 primary systems on which to value each card; 
1: (Standalone) Each card must be valued on its own efficiency relative to all other cards within the game that could produce its effect. 
2: (Synergy) Each card must also be valued secondarily by its “synergy” with other cards in a give decklist.
